# Architecting the Next-Generation Customer Tiering System  
### A KPI-Driven, Data-Integrated Architecture for Customer Tiering  
_Fusing Statistical Clustering, Semi-Supervision, and Policy-Aligned Optimization_

---

## 📌 Overview  

This repository contains the full codebase and documentation for our UCLA Anderson MSBA x Microsoft Capstone project.  
We designed a modern, data-driven customer tiering system that unifies **static segmentation**, **semi-supervised signals**, and **KPI-driven strategic design** to replace traditional heuristic-based market tiers.

Our objective was to build a segmentation architecture that is:
- **Statistically principled**  
- **Business-aligned**  
- **Operationally deployable**  
- **Transparent and reproducible**
