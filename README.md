# kpi-driven-clustering
This repository contains an end-to-end workflow for customer segmentation and tier assignment, combining classical clustering methods (Ward, KMeans) with **KPI-optimized policies** (SFI, PI, revenue). The project explores how unsupervised learning can be aligned with business objectives to create stable, meaningful tiers.
